An episode about the space flight achievements of the Space Shuttle, not about the shuttle itself. 

Our guest will be David Sivolella, and it will be based on this book: https://www.amazon.de/Space-Shuttle-Program-Technologies-Accomplishments/dp/3319549448

Introduction
---------------------
* Introduce yourself and your background
* How is this episode different from the first one we recorded together?
* How did you structure the book, and why?

Achievements
-------------------------
* The Shuttle as a Launch Platform
  - Idea was to launch all sats via the shuttle
  - Different deployment methods
    - spring
    - roll out
    - upper stages
  - Upper Stages in the Bay
    - Different ones: Inertial Upper Stage, Centaur, Advanced Shuttle Upper Stage
    - Solid vs. Liquid? 
    - Problems of cryo propulsion.
    - What was the Death Star mission
  - After Challenger, what changed?
    - Fewer Sats.
    - Very few deep space missions
    
* EVA
  - Planned from the beginning or just as contingency?
    - What kinds of contingencies were imagined?
    - E.g. payload bay doors might not close.
    - Or the tank attachment doors on the underside
    - There were contingency EVAs, but relating to payload, right?
  - Up to 8 hours. Really a fitness challenge!
  - Really only started with Shuttle. Not much before.
  - Suitable Space Suits 
    - New? EMU. Structure?
    - How many uses?
    - How to fit to astronauts, modularity? 
    - Fitting difficulties. "You get taller in space".
    - Not really comfortable... rigid. Gloves rigid. Cold! Heaters.
    - Always Thethered ... 
  - And then SAFER
  - The MMU
    - What was it?
    - What did they do?
    - Automatic Attitude Hold mode.
    - Why discontinued?

* Building the Station
  - ISS could not have been built w/o shuttle's payload capability.
  - How did they learn to build structures in space? 
    - Payload Flight Test Article
    - Structural Test Article
    - Assembly Concept for Construction of Erectable Space Structures (ACCESS)
    - Experimental Assembly for Structures in Extravehicular Activity (EASE)
    - Fine-grained assembly was discarded.
    - Assembly of Station by Extravehicular Activity Methods (ASEM)
    - CETA (the cart to move around)
    - All of this really vital for later station assembly.
  - The role of the Arm
    - initially, people were skepical about it?
    - Not so simple, b/c of actio-reactio 
    - Discussion about different control modes: direct vs. inverse kinematic       
  - Prox Ops close to heavy stuff.
  
* Satellite Servicing
  - Astronauts would actually "catch" sats! 
    - Weight vs. Inertia  
    - slow down spinning.
  - Manually. And then repair.
    - MMU, attitude hold mode
    - Canadarm plus "standing on the shuttle"
  - Were satellites specifically designed to be serviceable?
  - Other challenges, e.g., maneouver the shuttle in a way to make sure
    the sat's fuel did not freeze
  - Improv? Syncom. "Well, we've got it, Houston. They didn't ask why/how".
  - Hubble Repair. Multiple Missions.
  - Economically useful?
  
* Science Lab
  - The Sortie Can, RAM
  - Spacelab: How did the Europeans get involved?
    - Spacelab also had the pallette parts - little known
    - No living/sleeping in the lab.
  - Interfacing with Shuttle
    - Power
    - Environmental Control System?
    - Warnings/Caution integration
  - Two engineering pearls
    - the connector tunnel challenges
    - the problem with the shuttle CoG -> lots of empty bay space on Spacelab missions
  - Spacelab summarized:
    - Was the science worth it?
    - Did it technically work?
    - How many missions?
  - The controversy about science astronauts/payload specialists
    - accompany "their" experiments - Walker (flew several times)
    - much less training!
    - (Merbold, Furrer, Ockels, Messerschmidt)
    - this is why the rest of crew was skepical. 
  - Other science facililties (Briefly)
    - ASP
    - GAS
    - Hitchhikers
    - Middeck experiments -> which led to Spacehab (on 18 missions!!)
    
* Industry in Space
  - what was the idea: "production" in space.
  - Example (explain very briefly)
    - Electrophoresis (in middeck)
    - The wafer thingies in the Wake Field Facility (free flyer)
  - Engineering diddy: WFF was used to test the effect of shuttle thrusters
    on other spacecraft flying closely b/c it had very sensitive accelerometers
  - Didn't really work out: 
    - whenever the snags were fixed, things didn't fly again.  
    - Do we know why? Ultimately not worth it?
    - Challenger explosion?
  - But Spacehab was kinda more or less private?

* Military Flights
  - What do we know?
  - Relationship between USAF and NASA strained 
    - ... after Challenger: no more launches of sats on Shuttle
    - ... despite initial cross-range/payload bay requirements
    - ... culture clash between USAF secrecy and NASA openness (for safety)
  - Vandenberg was a complete joke.
    - idea: launch with more inclination
    - "jet engines for anti-icing"
  - The MISTY mission. 
    - Dogleg to 62 degrees. Less payload.
    - Satellite showed up later at 65
    
* The tethered satellite
  (you discuss it very externsively - you seem to be fascinated by it :))
  - What? TSS-1
  - Why?
  - Lots of interesting interactions and vibration modes of the tether
  - Also engineering challenges in the reeling system, which led to the (more or less) failures.
  
* Conclusion 
  - Your view - was it worth it?
  - How might a possible Future have looked if the Columbia Disaster had not happend? 
  - Currently, people are mostly skepical (I am not!)
